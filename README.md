This repository used to track my learning progress.

[User persona](https:github.com/ericxq27/Py-Learning/blob/main/machine-learning/User%20Persona.ipynb)
- Segment social media user data into user groups. Through PCA dimensionality reduction and K-Means clustering, users are successfully divided into groups with clear business value, such as "community builders" and "information broadcasters".

[Predict users gender](https:github.com/ericxq27/Py-Learning/blob/main/machine-learning/Predict%20Users'%20gender.ipynb)
- Build a gender prediction model. Through data cleaning, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning (random search), we finally trained a high-performance random forest classifier. EDA and feature importance analysis clearly pointed out that "emotionality" is the most critical predictor in this task.
